Problem 9

We consider any paythagorean triplet

eq A
a^2 + b^2 = c^2  

We define k to be the gcd(a,b,c), and a = kA, b =kB and c=kCj. We can rewrite eq A as:

(kA)^2 + (kB)^2 = (kC)^2

and divide through by k^2

eq B
A^2 + B^2 = C^2

The triple (A,B,C) form another pythagorean triple.

Theorem:
The triple (A,B,C) has gcd(A,B,C)=1.

Proof:
Suppose that the gcd is not 1 but some other number l. Then we define

A = lX
B = lY
C = lZ

=>
a=klA
b=klB
c=klC

=> 
gcd(a,b,c) = kl but this cannot be true because gcd(a,b,c) = k by definition 

Definition:
A triple (A,B,C) with gcd(A,B,C)=1 is called a primitve Pythagorean triple.

Theorem:
All pythagorean triples can be represented uniquely by d,A,B,C where d is any number in N and (A,B,C) are a primitive Pythagorean triple.

Proof:

Consider a primitive pythagorean triple (A,B,C) then for each k in N (kA,kB,KC) is also a Pythagorean triple. For any two distinct values k1, k2 in N 
it is clear that (k1A,k1B,k1C) and (k2A,k2B,k2C) are distinct.

Consider the set of all distinct primitive Pythagorean triples {(A1,B1,C1), (A2,B2,C2)...} and any k1 k2 in N. 
Let (k1A1, k1B1, k1C1) = (k2A2, k2B2, k2C2)

ie
k1A1=k2A2
k1B1=k2B2
k1C1=k2C2

then 
A1=(k2A2)/k1
B1=(k2B2)/k1
C1=(k2C2)/k1

Since A1,B1 and C1 are natural numbers then one of the following must be true.

Assertion 1: k2 / k1 exactly
Assertion 2: A2,B2 and C2 / k1 exactly

if Assertion 1 is true then this implies that gcd(A1,B1,C1) = k2/k1 but gcd(A1,B1,C1) = 1 so this cannot be true.

if Assertion 2 is true then this implies that the k1 is a divisor of A2,B2 and C2 but gcd(A2,B2,C2) = 1 so this cannot be true.

So far we have shown that (d,A,B,C) represents a unique Pythagorean triplet. To show that this represents all Pythagorean triplets we know 
that any triplet (a,b,c) can be reduced to a primitive (A,B,C) by dividing by gcd(a,b,c). Therefore all triplets can be generated by  (d,A,B,C).


A different way to represent a Pythagorean triple

We can note that a paramaterisation (m,n) of the form

where
a=m^2 - n^2
b=2*m*n
c=m^2 + n^2

for any natural numbers m,n will produce a pythagorean triple. This is evident by substituting into the formula
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Theorem 
A Pythagorean triplet is primitive if and only if m and n are coprimes and exactly one of them is even.


Proof:
=>
If a Pythgorean triplet is primitive then m and n are coprimes and exactly one of them is even.
