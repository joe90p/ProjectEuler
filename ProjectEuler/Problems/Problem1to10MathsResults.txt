Problem 9

We consider any paythagorean triplet

eq A
a^2 + b^2 = c^2  

We define k to be the gcd(a,b,c), and a = kA, b =kB and c=kCj. We can rewrite eq A as:

(kA)^2 + (kB)^2 = (kC)^2

and divide through by k^2

eq B
A^2 + B^2 = C^2

The triple (A,B,C) form another pythagorean triple.

Theorem:
The triple (A,B,C) has gcd(A,B,C)=1.

Proof:
Suppose that the gcd is not 1 but some other number l. Then we define

A = lX
B = lY
C = lZ

=>
a=klA
b=klB
c=klC

=> 
gcd(a,b,c) = kl but this cannot be true because gcd(a,b,c) = k by definition 

Definition:
A triple (A,B,C) with gcd(A,B,C)=1 is called a primitve Pythagorean triple.

Theorem:
All pythagorean triples can be represented uniquely by d,A,B,C where d is any number in N and (A,B,C) are a primitive Pythagorean triple.

Proof:

Consider a primitive pythagorean triple (A,B,C) then for each k in N (kA,kB,KC) is also a Pythagorean triple. For any two distinct values k1, k2 in N 
it is clear that (k1A,k1B,k1C) and (k2A,k2B,k2C) are distinct.

Consider the set of all distinct primitive Pythagorean triples {(A1,B1,C1), (A2,B2,C2)...} and any k1 k2 in N. 
Let (k1A1, k1B1, k1C1) = (k2A2, k2B2, k2C2)

ie
k1A1=k2A2
k1B1=k2B2
k1C1=k2C2

then 
A1=(k2A2)/k1
B1=(k2B2)/k1
C1=(k2C2)/k1

Since A1,B1 and C1 are natural numbers then one of the following must be true.

Assertion 1: k2 / k1 exactly
Assertion 2: A2,B2 and C2 / k1 exactly

if Assertion 1 is true then this implies that gcd(A1,B1,C1) = k2/k1 but gcd(A1,B1,C1) = 1 so this cannot be true.

if Assertion 2 is true then this implies that the k1 is a divisor of A2,B2 and C2 but gcd(A2,B2,C2) = 1 so this cannot be true.

So far we have shown that (d,A,B,C) represents a unique Pythagorean triplet. To show that this represents all Pythagorean triplets we know 
that any triplet (a,b,c) can be reduced to a primitive (A,B,C) by dividing by gcd(a,b,c). Therefore all triplets can be generated by  (d,A,B,C).


A different way to represent a Pythagorean triple

We can note that a paramaterisation (m,n) of the form

where
a=m^2 - n^2
b=2*m*n
c=m^2 + n^2

for any natural numbers m,n will produce a pythagorean triple. This is evident by substituting into the formula
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Theorem 
A Pythagorean triplet is primitive if and only if m and n are coprime and exactly one of them is even.


Proof:

We shall use the following substitutions for the statements
X=Pythagorean triplet is primitive
Y = m,n coprime
Z = exactly one of m,n is even

Proof of X => Y AND Z

We shall show that the logically equivalent ~Y OR ~Z => ~X is true.

Assume that gcd(n,m)= d > 1 then there exists p,q such that m=p*d and n=q*d substitutin the into the value fors a,b,c we see that
a=d^2(p^2 - q^2) 
b=2*d^2*m*n
c=d^2(p^2 - q^2) 

We see that d^2 is a divisor of a,b,c and therefore the triplet is not primitive. Therefore ~Y => ~X

If both n and m are odd (or both even) then a,b and c are even (this can be seens by plugging in the values for m and n in the equations for a,b,c), 
and thus 2 is a common divisor. Therefore ~Z => ~X

Therefore ~Y OR ~Z => ~X

Proof of Y AND Z => X

Consider the truth table

Y     Z     X     Y AND Z=>X

T     T     T     T
T     T     F     F
T     F     T     T
T     F     F     T
F     T     T     T
F     T     F     T
F     F     T     T
F     F     F     T

(For a nice description of truth tables see http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)

Suppose that Y AND Z=>X is false, from the above we can see that this must mean that Y and Z are true and X is false.

However it can also be shown that ~X AND Z=>~Y 

Since the triplet is not primitive a prime p is divisible with a, b and c. From the condition that exactly one of m and n is odd, 
it follows that a and c are also odd and b is odd, therefore a prime p dividing a,b and c will be odd.
Any odd prime that divides b must also divide m and/or n, without loss of generality assume that it divides m. 
Thus it must also divide m^2. Since the prime is also a divisor of c = m^2 + n^2, then it follows that it must divide n^2 and n as well. 
(this follows from notions and facts part of the divisor article on wikipedia) Therefore p is a divisor of m and n, and therefore m and n are not 
coprimes. ie  ~X AND Z=>~Y.



Therefore Y is true and false, which is absurd, therefore what we originally supposed
is wrong therefore Y AND Z=>X is true. 

Theorem:
A coprime pair m,n with exactly one even represents a unique primitive Pythagorean triplet.

Proof:

Suppose that there exist m1,n1 and m2,n2 where m1 does not equal m2 and n1 does not equal n2
where 

a=m1^2 - n1^2 = m2^2 - n2^2
b=2*m1*n1 = 2*m2*n2
c=m1^2 + n1^2 = m2^2 + n2^2

The equation for b
implies that either m1/m2 or n1/m2
AND
either m1/n2 or n1/n2

ie 1. (m1/m2 AND m1/n2) OR 2. (m1/m2 AND n1/n2) OR 3. (n1/m2 AND m1/n2) OR 4. (n1/m2 AND n1/n2)


1. Since m1 and n1 contain no commn factors n1 cannot have m2 or n2 as factors  but we can see by arranging b n1 = (m2*n2)/ m1, m2 or n2 must be factors so we are reduced to an absurdity.

2. let m1 = s*m2 and n1= t*n2

from c (s^2 * m2^2) +(t^2 *n2^2) = m2^2 + n2^2
implies s^2 - 1 = 0 and t^2 - 1 = 0
which implies that s and t are 1 but we assumed m1 did not equal m2 and n1 did not equal n2. So we have reduced to an absurdity

3. let n1 = s*m2, m1=t*n2

From c
t*n2^2 + s*m2^2 = m2^2 + n2^2
implies s^2 - 1 = 0 and t^2 - 1 = 0 ie n1=m2, m1=n2 since we don't care about order (m1,n1) = (m2,n2)
but we assumed m1 did not equal m2 and n1 did not equal n2. So we have reduced to an absurdity

4. Since m1 and n1 contain no commn factors m1 cannot have m2 or n2 as factors of m1 but we can see by arranging b m1 = (m2*n2)/ n1 m2 or n2 must be factors so we are reduced to an absurdity.

Therefore the original assertion was wrong.

Using the results above we can now say

Result

All pythagorean triples can be represented uniquely by d,m,n where d is any number in N and m,n are coprime with exactly one even.



The problem says that a + b + c = s

a + b+ c = s = d(m^2-n^2) + 2d*m*n + d(m^2+n^2) = 2m(m+n)d

We can see that m must be a divisor of s/2 and, since (m+n)d >m, m < sqrt(s/2)

and we need to find a k = m+n such that k is a divisor to s/(2m) and

m <k < 2m, since n>0 and we have chosen n<m

k <= s/(2m), since d >= 1

k is odd and gcd(m,k) = 1.

In our problem it means that m < 23, thus decreasing the first number we need to find by a factor 10. 
The second number k, we need to find has an upper bound depending on m but is in the same vicinity. 
Once we have found m and k, the rest can be calculated easily. 

Since we are told in the question there is only one pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000 once we 
have found any m,k satisfying the above conditions we have our answer.
